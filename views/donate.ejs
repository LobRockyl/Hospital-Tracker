<meta name="description" content="The Hospital Tracker is a non-profit social platform aimed to gather these reports against the healthcare giants, 
hospitals, and nursing homes in critical states in India. Instead of just posting on social media, we gather 
authenticated reports against the hospitals or anything related, so that this pack of authenticated reports and 
behaviour can be claimed by the people who practice law or are at a place of power to take action based on authenticated hospital data" />
